							<p>John, we have been buying from some guys out of Las Vegas. I don't know of any factories in Vegas, just gambling casinos. I am sure our pins were coming from China, as is everything else in our Country. I will not buy Chinese. Your pins and keys are really nice and we are satisfied with the beautiful quality of your work. I reccomend you to anyone. Your prices are very fair, the service is good, and the quality if superb.<br />

Thanks again and have a good evening.<br />

					   <p>&quot;John,
We received the pins and presented them to our Town Manager at today’s Staff meeting.
The response was overwhelming! All are extremely please with your craftsmanship and the beauty of the pins.
So much so, that it was discussed of having a second pin created for another location in the Town.
I will share your brochure with that department and get back to you.Please keep our pin in your records for re-orders in the future.
Again, congratulations on creating a superior piece of jewelry.

                    idea how these would turn out when we first   started. Mr. Lewis sent me the art <br />

                    couldn't believe my eyes. We were so proud to   give these to our Distinguished <br />

Although is has taken some time to make a decision on the type and size   of pin, I realize now that selecting <img src="images/testimonials/lombardprint.jpg" width="157" height="170" hspace="3" align="left" />Keytocity.com to handle our order was a   great decision. The larger size that you recommended shows off our Village seal   much better then the smaller size that we had previously. The image of the logo   is much sharper and the colors more vibrant. We will be proud to hand these pins   out to citizens. </p>
                  <p align="left">Again, thank you for all of your assistance in   making the decisions that have led us to this great-looking pin. We look forward   to ordering from you again once our supply diminishes. </p>

Everyone I have given one out to has always asked for one or two   more for other people. They are going fast and I'll probably have to place   another order soon. The quality and detail are absolutely amazing. Thank you   again for a great product and a great service.&quot;</em></p>
